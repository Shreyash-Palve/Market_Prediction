Training Phase
Your notebook must use the time-series module to make predictions
CPU Notebook <= 5 hours run-time
GPU Notebook <= 5 hours run-time
TPU Notebooks are not supported
Freely & publicly available external data is allowed, including pre-trained models


Forecasting Phase
Because the size of the test set will change during the live forecasting phase, the time limits will be adjusted in proportion to the test set size, with a 10% added time allowance.
As a hypothetical example, if there are 1,000,000 test rows and a 5 hour runtime limit during the training phase and the forecasting phase has 2,000,000 rows, your notebook will be allowed 10 hours + 10% = 11 hours during the forecasting phase.
